ok it finally works

I'm going to type up what you should do when stuff happens

... in a few seconds


Okay, here's what you need to do whenever you want to work on the project

1. open Git bash and navigate to the project directory with cd (so pretty much type "cd Badminton")
2. type "git init" to initialize the repository
3. type "git pull", which downloads any changes I might have made to the repository, so the project is up to date
4. work on it, code and stuff
5. when you want to update the repository with your changes, go back to the directory in git bash, do the git init
    stuff if you haven't already
6. type "git add .", which stages all the files in the project
7. type "git commit -m "description"", which updates the local repository with the changes you've made
	"description" is a message you leave to describe what changes you made in a nutshell. Like these     ---->
8. type "git push" to upload the changes to the remote repository so I can download them

and that's it I'm pretty sure.

Cool

I'm gonna add this file to the project, and then you can try making a new commit.
